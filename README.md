## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning

Your Session ID provides complete access to your WhatsApp account, just like a password.

-   **NEVER share your Session ID with anyone.**
-   **DO NOT post your Session ID publicly** (e.g., on GitHub, Pastebin, etc.).
-   This application is designed to be secure by deleting session files from the server instantly. Always ensure you are running a trusted version of this code.
